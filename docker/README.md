# Docker Compose Local Setup

This directory contains Docker Compose configuration for running the code ingestion system locally with Qdrant as the vector database.

```

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker and Docker Compose** installed
2. **Environment variables** configured:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure embedding service (DeepInfra)
   - Add GitHub token for repository cloning

## Quick Start

1. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set:
   # - DEEPINFRA_API_KEY
   # - GITHUB_TOKEN (for cloning repos)
   # 
   # Optional: For Qdrant Cloud instead of local Docker:
   # - QDRANT_URL (e.g., https://your-cluster.cloud.qdrant.io)
   # - QDRANT_API_KEY
   ```

   Both entrypoints also accept `<VAR>_FILE` instead of `<VAR>` for
   `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (ingest only) and `QDRANT_API_KEY`: the
   value is read from that file (`docker/load-secret-files.sh`). This is how
   the ss-ai chart delivers credentials; setting both forms is an error.

2. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This will:
   - Start Qdrant on port 6333 (with web UI on 6333/dashboard)
   - Run ingestion (full re-ingestion: clone or refresh repos with git pull, run discovery, ingest code to Qdrant, derive dependencies)
   - Start MCP server on port 8001 with health endpoint

   By default every run of the stack performs a full re-ingestion so recent commits and changes in repos are reflected.

### Running without re-ingestion

To use existing vector data and only run Qdrant and the MCP server (skip ingestion):

```bash
docker compose up qdrant mcp
```

Do not start the `ingest` service. MCP will serve queries against the existing vector data; no clone, refresh, or ingestion is performed.

3. **Check health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/health
   ```

   Response when ready:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ready",
     "qdrant": "ok",
     "ingestion": "complete",
     "backend_type": "qdrant"
   }
   ```

   While ingestion is running:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "waiting_for_ingestion",
     "qdrant": "ok",
     "ingestion": "pending",
     "backend_type": "qdrant"
   }
   ```

4. **Access Qdrant web UI**:
   ```bash
   # Open Qdrant dashboard in browser
   open http://localhost:6333/dashboard
   ```

## Services

### Qdrant
- **Port**: 6333 (HTTP API), 6334 (gRPC)
- **Data**: Persisted in Docker volume `code-ingest-qdrant-data`
- **Web UI**: `http://localhost:6333/dashboard`
- **Health**: `http://localhost:6333/`

### Ingestion
- **Type**: One-shot (restarts: "no")
- When the ingest service runs it: (1) refreshes repos already in `/app/repos` with `git pull`, then clones any repo from `config/repositories.yaml` not yet on disk (a failed clone is logged and skipped); (2) runs repository discovery (Helm, languages, repo type); (3) runs the full ingestion pipeline; (4) runs derive_dependencies. Each run is a full re-ingestion with up-to-date repo content.
- **Priority filter**: Set `PRIORITY=high|medium|low|ALL` in `.env` (default: low)
- **Status file**: Writes `/app/status/ingestion_complete` when done
- **Logs**: `docker compose logs ingest`

### MCP Server
- **Port**: 8001 (stdio for MCP, HTTP for health)
- **Health endpoint**: `http://localhost:8001/health`
- **Depends on**: Qdrant (and optionally ingestion completion)
- **Logs**: `docker compose logs mcp`

## Volumes

- **qdrant-data**: Persistent vector database storage
- **ingest-status**: Shared status files (ingestion completion flag)
- **./repos**: Bind-mounted for local repo access (optional)
- **./config**: Bind-mounted for shared configuration

## Configuration

### Priority-based Ingestion

Control which repositories to ingest:

```bash
# High priority only
PRIORITY=high docker compose up

# Medium + high (default)
PRIORITY=medium docker compose up

# All repositories
PRIORITY=ALL docker compose up
```

### Repository Configuration

Edit `config/repositories.yaml` to add/remove repositories:

```yaml
repositories:
  - id: my-service
    github_url: https://github.com/myorg/my-service
    repo_type: backend
    languages: [rust]
    priority: high
```

### Using Qdrant Cloud

To use Qdrant Cloud instead of local Docker:

1. Set in `.env`:
   ```bash
   QDRANT_URL=https://your-cluster.cloud.qdrant.io
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
   ```

2. Start services (skip local Qdrant):
   ```bash
   docker compose up ingest mcp
   ```

## Stopping and Cleanup

```bash
# Stop services (preserves data)
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (deletes data)
docker compose down -v

# Restart just ingestion
docker compose up ingest

# Restart just MCP
docker compose restart mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Ingestion fails
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs ingest

# Common issues:
# - Missing GITHUB_TOKEN
# - Missing embedding service credentials
# - Qdrant not ready (check healthcheck)
```

### MCP health shows "waiting_for_ingestion"
This is normal while ingestion is running. Wait for ingestion to complete.

### Verifying Qdrant collections (0 collections in MCP)
Collections are created and filled by the **ingestion** service. You will see 0 collections until ingestion has run successfully at least once (`docker compose up` with the full stack, or `docker compose up ingest` after Qdrant is up).

To verify Qdrant from the host:

```bash
# Access Qdrant web UI
open http://localhost:6333/dashboard

# Or use curl
curl http://localhost:6333/collections
```

Or run the Qdrant client test:

```bash
python modules/ingest/services/vector_client.py
```

### Qdrant connection refused
```bash
# Check Qdrant health
curl http://localhost:6333/

# Check logs
docker compose logs qdrant

# Check if container is running
docker ps | grep qdrant
```

### Reset everything
```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

## Using with Cursor IDE

1. Start services: `docker compose up`
2. Wait for health: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`
3. This project includes `.cursor/mcp.json` with **code-ingest-mcp** pointing at `http://localhost:8001/mcp`. Cursor will pick it up when you open the repo.
4. If the server is disabled in Cursor, enable it under **Settings → Features → MCP** (URL-based servers can be off by default).
5. MCP server will query local Qdrant for semantic code search.

## Vector Database

This setup uses **Qdrant** as the vector database. It runs in a container with data persisted in a Docker volume. 

**Features:**
- Web UI for browsing collections and vectors
- 4096-dimensional vectors with cosine similarity
- Persistent storage in Docker volume
- Optional: Switch to Qdrant Cloud by setting `QDRANT_URL` and `QDRANT_API_KEY`

No cloud vector service is required for local development - the Docker Compose stack includes everything you need.
